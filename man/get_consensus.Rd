\title{Get Consensus Sequences from a FASTA File}
\usage{
get_consensus(fasta, splits = 10000, cores = 1, genome = "hg38")
}
\arguments{
\item{fasta}{A character string specifying the path to the FASTA file.}

\item{splits}{An integer specifying the number of segments to split the sequence into for processing. Default is 10,000.}

\item{cores}{An integer specifying the number of cores to use for parallel processing. Default is 1.}

\item{genome}{A character string specifying the genome version for sequence information. Default is "hg38".}
}
\value{
A \code{GRanges} object containing the consensus sequences with their genomic ranges and associated sequence information.
}
\description{
This function reads a DNA sequence from a given FASTA file, splits the sequences for parallel processing,
and retrieves consensus sequences for each split segment.
}
\details{
The function reads the input FASTA file, splits each sequence into smaller segments for parallel processing,
and retrieves consensus sequences for each segment. The results are combined into a \code{GRanges} object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Example usage:
  fasta_file <- "path/to/your/file.fasta"
  consensus <- get_consensus(fasta_file, splits = 5000, cores = 2, genome = "hg38")
  print(consensus)
}
